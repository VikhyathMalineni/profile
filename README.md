This is my portfolio website!

The goal behind this website is to be able to showcase who I am, what skills I have, what projects I have built, what topics I have experience on, and how to contact me. It is for people to get to know me and contact me.

It is complete with all of these things:
- All my biggest projects
- All of my skills
- What I am interested in
- What I am talented at
- A timeline of when I started my hobbies
- How to contact me
- An emailing system within the website

  This project has been a big goal of mine for a while and I am glad I put in the time and effort to make it.

  PS, the reason I have so less commmits is because I only found out about what github commits are during teh 11 hour mark of my project, I did not know what they are or that they were requiered up untill then. Please excuse me for that. If you have any questions on how I built everyhting up until that point, please let me know.
